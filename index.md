# codeX Setup Intro

Welcome to project codeX!

<!--codex ignore just-->
We hope that you will enjoy this journey with us and that you will learn and apply lots of new skills in the process.

## Assumptions

This introduction assumes that you have completed both these courses in Codecademy:

 * [HTML & CSS](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web)
 * [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript)

 That you completed the [project codex bootcamp](http://bootcamp.projectcodex.co)

<!--codex ignore just-->
And that you are familiar with using these concepts in JavaScript:

* variables
* functions
* conditioanl statements
* loops
* basic objects


## Now what?

 Now we are going to remove the side wheels, things might start feeling a bit unstable. To prove to you that you are not alone in this, have a look at [Why Learning to Code is So Damn Hard (What every beginner absolutely needs to know about the journey ahead)](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard). It's quite a long, but interesting, read.

Now you know that you are not alone let's get going.

## Overview

### Register

We would like you to register for a few online tools that we will be using at codeX.

**Please register and familiarize yourself with:**

* [GitHub](http://www.github.com)
* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com)
* [Twitter](http://twitter.com)

You should spend about 10 mins on each site, seeing what each does and checking out the different features.

### Tools of the trade

Next steps are to get you going with a few tools.
Work your way through each of these exercises: they're challenging but rewarding!

* [Mastering the command line](command_line.html)
* [Some software to install](software_to_install.html)
* [Version control with Git](know_git.html)

## Let's code

So far most of the code you have written might have been inside of a browser. That's about to change!

In reality most software is written in text editors or using a more advanced text editor called an Integrated Development Environment (or IDE for short). We will use a text editor called [Atom](https://atom.io/).

* Learn how to find problems in your code by using [Debugging tools](debug_tools.html)

* Now start to [do some coding ](http://frontend_basics.projectcodex.co), but ask the mentors for an Introduction to Front End programming before you proceed.
