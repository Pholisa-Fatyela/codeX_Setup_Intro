## T7 Dynamically updating the DOM with javascript

Now lets's look at how we can add things to the DOM with JavaScript. We'll need this for the next task. Using TDD, create a function that

* inserts a `div` with the `id` `testresults` into the DOM
* adds a child element of `#testresults` that has the class `fail`
    * add the text "Test failed."
* adds a child element of `#testresults` that has the class `pass`
    * add the text "Test passed."

Have a look at [The Basics of JavaScript DOM Manipulation](http://callmenick.com/2014/03/27/basics-javascript-dom-manipulation/) to get some ideas.
