## T1 Create Red and Green Blocks

> This task requires HTML & CSS

Create a file called `task1.html` that looks something like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>header!</title>

	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="">

	<style type="text/css">
	/* CSS goes here */
	</style>
</head>
<body>
	<!-- HTML goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

Now you'll write some CSS in the `style` tag in the `head` of the HTML file. Create two blocks that are `10em` wide. The first block should have a red background, and say "stop." The second block should have a green background, and say "go." Both blocks should have white text.

Once you are done, add your changes to git by using these commands:

* `git pull` to get any remote changes
* `git status` to see what changed
* `git add .` to add everything to git
* `git commit -m "task 1 is done"` to commit your changes to git
*  `git push -u origin master` to push your changes to github
