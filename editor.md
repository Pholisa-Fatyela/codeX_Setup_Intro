# The Atom text editor

[Atom](https://atom.io/) is a text editor with lots of nice features that make your life as a developer much easier.

A few of Atom's features include:

* Basic code completion, based on content in your file
* Syntax highlighting
* HTML tag completion
* HTML file basic templates

Let's try some things:

<!--codex ignore easy-->
* Create a file called index.html, and open it in your text editor
* At the first line in the file type `html`
* Press `tab`
* What happened?
* Save the file
* In the body tag type `h1`
* Press `tab` again
* What happened?
* In the body of the tag you just created type 'Hello, world!'

Now that you're more familiar with the tool set, you're ready to write some code.
