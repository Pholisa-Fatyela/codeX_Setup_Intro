## T3 Colour the blocks with buttons

> This task requires HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This task will require you to use JavaScript to:

* manipulate the styling by adding classes
* add some button click event handlers

To handle clicks on buttons, you can use [addEventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener).

## Tasks

In a file called `task3.html` create an HTML page that:

* displays two blocks that are `10em` wide and have a grey background. The first block should have a red background, and say "stop." The second block should have a green background, and say "go."
* has a `button` underneath each block
    * the `button` text under the first block should be 'Make red'
    * the `button` text under the second block should be 'Make green'
* adds a `class` to the first block that makes the background red when the `button` under the first block is pressed
* adds a `class` to the second block that makes the background green when the `button` under the second block is pressed

The start of your HTML file should look look something like this.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>header!</title>
   <!-- Your CSS goes in the task3.css file -->
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="task3.css">
</head>
<body>
	<!-- HTML goes here -->
	<script type="text/javascript">
		// JavaScript code goes here at the bottom
	</script>
</body>
</html>
```

Once you are done, add your changes to git.
