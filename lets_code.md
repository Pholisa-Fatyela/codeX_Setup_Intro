# Let's code!

Now we are going to write some code outside of Codecademy.

You should have a projects folder in your home directory, it's good practice to create all your different projects in one place on your PC that you can find easily.

In your projects folder:

* create a folder called RedAndGreen
* change into the folder RedAndGreen using `cd RedAndGreen`
* initialize it as a git repository using this command `git init`

In GitHub create a new repository called 'RedAndGreen':

* to do that click on the + sign left from your profile name
* now select 'New repository'
* enter the repository name 'RedAndGreen'
* now click 'Create repository'

You will be presented with a few different setup options, you need to follow the instructions under:

  **...or push an existing repository from the command line**

the parameters will be specific to your environment and you can copy and paste them into your RedAndGreen local directory in the terminal.  

The command would look like this, with your own git username:

```
git remote add origin git@github.com:<your_git_username>/RedAndGreen.git
```

Files:

* as you do each task create the files in the 'RedAndGreen' folder
* after each task remember to add your changes to git

## Task 1

[Create Red and Green Squares](t1-create-red-and-green-squares.md)

## Task 2

[Colour the squares](t2-colour-the-squares.md)

## Task 3

[One square changing colours](t3-one-square-changing-colours.md)

## Publishing

[Publish your code to a website](publish-your-code-to-a-website.md)

## Task 4

[One button to change square colours](t4-one-button-to-change-square-colours.md)

## Let's make navigation easier

TODO - add steps to add a navigation menu that links to all the tasks they did in this project so far.

## Task 5

[Test your function](t5-test-your-function.md)

## Task 6

[Test changing colours](t6-test-changing-colours.md)

## Task 7

[Display Test Results](t7-display-test-results.md)

##Task 8

[Unit Testing Framework](t8-unit-testing-framework.md)

**Now head over to**

Now head over to [53 functions](https://github.com/codex-academy/53functions/blob/master/README.md) and write some functions. You should be using the Unit testing framework you created in Task 7 & 8 to test the first 5 functions.
