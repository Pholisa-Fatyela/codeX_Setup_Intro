## T4 One block changing colours

> This task requires HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Create 3 files:

* `task4.html` - all HTML in here
* `task4.css` - all CSS in here
* `task4.js` - all JavaScript in here

Using the above 3 files create a web page that:

* displays a block that is `10em` wide and has a grey background.
* has two `button`s under the block: one that says 'Make red' and one that says 'Make green'
* makes the background of the block red when the `button` under the block is pressed, by changing the `class` of the block, and adds text to the block so that it says "stop."
* makes the background of the block green when the `button` under the block is pressed, by changing the `class` of the block, and adds text to the block so that it says "go."

Have a look at [innerHTML](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_html_innerhtml.asp) for how to change the text of the block.

The start of your HTML file should look look something like this. This time we're putting our CSS and our JavaScript in different files.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>header!</title>
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="task3.css">
</head>
<body>
	<!-- HTML goes here -->
	<script type="text/javascript" src="task3.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Once you're done, add your changes to git by using similar commands to the ones you used for the previous tasks. If you want to add multiple files at the same time, you can do it like this:

```
git add task4.html task4.css task4.js
```

Now it's time for a [Short break from the JavaScript](lets_code.md#short-break-from-the-javascript).
