## T3 One block changing colours

> This task requires HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Create 3 files:

* `task3.html` - all HTML in here
* `task3.css` - all CSS in here
* `task3.js` - all JavaScript in here

Using the above 3 files create a web page that:

* displays a block that is `10em` wide and has a grey background
* has two `button`s under the block: one that says 'Make red' and one that says 'Make green'
* makes the background of the block red when the `button` under the block is pressed, by changing the `class` of the block
* makes the background of the block green when the `button` under the block is pressed, by changing the `class` of the block

The start of your HTML file should look look something like this. This time we're putting our CSS and our JavaScript in different files.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>header!</title>
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="task3.css">
</head>
<body>
	<!-- HTML goes here -->
	<script type="text/javascript" src="task3.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Once you're done, add your changes to git by using the same commands as you used for the tasks above.
