## T4 One button to change block colours

> This task requires HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Using separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript called `task4.html`, `task4.css`, and `task4.js` create a web page that:

1. displays a block that is `10em` wide and has a grey background
2. has one `button` under the block that says 'Make red'
3. makes the background of the block red when the `button` under the block is pressed, by changing the `class` of the block, changes the button text to 'Make green', and adds text to the block so that it says "stop."
4. makes the background of the block green when the `button` under the block is pressed, by changing the `class` of the block, changes the button text to 'Make red', and adds text to the block so that it says "go."
5. lets steps 3 and 4 be repeated

Once you're done, add your changes to git by using similar commands to the ones you used for the previous tasks.

You can use `git add .` to add all files in the current directory (except any files listed in your `.gitignore`).
